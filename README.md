<h1>National Park Exploration</h1>

This is a long term project that will (hopefully) involve the entire world's national park service data.
Starting with the US, I'm collecting data for all the national parks, and displaying them on an interactive map.

My main goal is to collect and organize all the scattered data out there on national parks into one system.
